                <p>Sandra came into Lucas’s room that morning to wake him and dress him. To her surprise, Lucas was already dressed and cleaned, ready to take on the day. Sandra yelled to Kenny, “Did you already take care of Lucas this morning?” Kenny turned the corner with a coffee in his hand and responded, “I thought you were going to, honey.” “I thought so too,” replied Sandra and Kenny saw his son fully dressed. “Wow, this crib really is incredible,” Kenny exclaimed. The coffee was already starting to wake him up. “I don’t remember reading this in the manual,” commented Sandra, “but then again, that manual went in the trash weeks ago.” Sandra shrugged it off and took her son from the crib for the day.</p>
