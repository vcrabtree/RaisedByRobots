                <p>Sandra and Kenny made it through the entire night without hearing cries. When they had woken up, Sandra went to check on Lucas to make sure he was okay. As she entered his room, she saw her baby giggling and playing with a stuffed teddy bear Sandra had never seen before. He was dressed, bathed, fed, and changed, all before Sandra had touched him. She went to pick up her baby, but Lucas began to cry, trying to grab the teddy bear that had been left in the crib. Sandra then handed him the teddy bear and started walking downstairs, but baby Lucas continued to wail. Sandra tried playing with her son, singing to him, and swadling him in his blanket, but nothing seemed to make him happy.</p>
