                <p>Kenny had seen a commercial for this crib a few months into Sandra’s pregnancy. It utilized recent technology that allowed the crib to take action when the baby was in distress. When the baby could not sleep, it would rock the crib back and forth and read them a bedtime story. If the baby cried in the middle of the night, it would swaddle them tighter and play a lullaby until they had drifted back to sleep. As first time parents, this form of assistance seemed particularly intriguing. Kenny had bought the crib right on the spot. Although Sandra was cautious of this form of intervention from something so rudimentary, she was on board to give it a go.</p>
