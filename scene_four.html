As she rushed to put her slippers on and head to Lucas’s bedroom, Kenny had woken too and was not far behind. But as the two new parents turned the corner to Lucas’s room, they saw their baby with a bottle already in his mouth. The crib had taken care of the child while the parent’s rushed to get there before waking their neighbors. “I’m already loving this crib,” said Kenny, somewhat groggy due to his abrupt wake up. “I’m beginning to come around to it too,” Sandra responded, “I wouldn’t mind a good night’s sleep every once in a while.” The couple went back to bed, leaving Lucas to his bottle.</p>
