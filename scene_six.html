                <p>At about 1:00 in the afternoon, after Kenny had been playing peek-a-boo with Lucas, he started to cry. Kenny, panicked, picked Lucas up, and brought him to the kitchen to grab him some food. However, as Kenny began airplaning a spoonful of applesauce towards Lucas, he cried even louder. “Okay, guess you’re not hungry,” said Kenny, puzzled as to what could be the problem. He then grabbed a bottle and tried to give that to baby Lucas, still having little luck. Confused and frustrated, Kenny began looking for the baby book he had gotten from the library when he thought of an idea. Kenny took the still crying Lucas upstairs and placed him in the crib. As Kenny was stepping back, the crib took action. In what felt like a blink of an eye, the crib had changed Lucas’s diaper and began rocking him back and forth. Instantly, the crying stopped. But, when Kenny grabbed Lucas from the crib to bring him back downstairs, Lucas’s crying began again. Kenny dropped the crying baby back in the crib instantly. The crib then swaddled Lucas and his eyes got heavy. “Must be naptime,” Kenny whispered to himself and he went back downstairs alone, leaving Lucas to his crib.</p>
