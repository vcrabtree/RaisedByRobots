                <p>Hesitantly, Sandra placed Lucas in the crib, and stepped back a few paces to see what would happen. As Lucas saw his mother move further and further away, he became distressed, and had started to cry. Although Sandra had already begun walking towards her baby once again, the crib had already taken action.

She looked back at him when she reached the door, but continued to walk away.</p>
