                <p>Sandra had woken from the nap she had taken, and walked downstairs to Kenny. When she saw him alone, she freaked out. “Kenny, where's our son? Did you lose him already?” She began pacing around the living room. “He’s asleep sweetheart, I put him down for a nap,” Kenny replied, still gazing at the lit up television. Relieved, Sandra sat next to her husband and glued her eyes to the screen as well.</p>

It’s been a few hours,” Sandra had asked Kenny as she pulled out plates and glasses. “I’m sure he’s alright, babies cry when they need anything. If you can’t hear him I’m sure he’s happy,” Kenny replied. Agreeing, Sandra did not go after her baby, but rather spent the night downstairs with her husband, eating dinner and hanging out. “Who knew being a parent would be so easy,” Kenny had remarked during their dinner.</p>
