                <p>The entire car ride home consisted of crying and sobbing from the back seat. As Kenny brought the new crib upstairs, Sandra bounced Lucas and tried to calm him down. She had little success, and Lucas was still wailing as Kenny dragged the old crib outside. As he placed the crib at the curb, the screaming escalated. Sandra and Kenny walked inside, and brought their baby to his new crib, hoping that would stop the baby’s screams. It only made things worse. The baby got even louder as he was placed into his new crib, his sobs almost hysterical. The couple spent hours trying to calm their child, trying everything they had read in the parenting books, but nothing seemed to help.</p>
