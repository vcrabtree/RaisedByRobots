                <p>After an entire night of no sleep and cries ringing in Kenny and Sandra’s ears, Kenny had grabbed his keys and left the house as soon as the stores opened once again. After about an hour of Sandra facing Lucas’s screams alone, she heard the door open. She looked outside of the baby’s room to see Kenny dragging a crib up the stairs. It looked just like the first one. Sandra said nothing. All she wanted was for the crying to stop. As soon as the crib was in Lucas’s line of vision, his tears halted instantly. Sandra picked her son up and placed him in the new crib. The house was silent once again.</p>
